# Learning Redux [Video]
This is the code repository for [Learning Redux [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/learning-redux-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781787125810), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Redux completes the missing piece of the React framework, and is used at the core of React for most complex React projects. In this course, we’ll be focusing on leveraging the Redux framework to impose better engineering on React applications. Redux is an implementation of FLUX, which is a pattern for managing application state in React. Redux brings a clean and testable design to the table using a purely functional approach.

The course begins with the basics of React development, where you will get a better understanding of how React applications are organized compared to other JavaScript applications. Then you will learn the principles of the Flux architecture before diving into one of its most popular implementations: Redux. You’ll build a simple React application and rewrite it with Redux. By the end of this section, our Redux code will be doing all the work so that our React components can be strictly presentational. 

Moving on, we’ll turn our simple client into a single page application. We’ll use react-router to allow different URLs to render different pages, and you’ll see how to break up our application state into groups of related data. We’ll focus on retrieving lists of records from the server and paginating them, starting by leveraging the Redux framework to implement our own pagination. Then we’ll replace most of the code we’ve written so far, with a third-party package that neatly solves the problem of form submission for us. 

After that, you’ll submit the form with axios, use react-router to redirect on success, and leverage toastr to display error notifications. Finally, we’ll rip out most of our code and replace it with a popular library that’s built to manage form state. At the end, you will focus on testing different libraries for our React components, and then test our asynchronous action creators and reducers.

Installation
React Redux requires React 0.14 or later.
npm install --save react-redux
This assumes that you’re using npm package manager with a module bundler like Webpack or Browserify to consume CommonJS modules.
If you don’t yet use npm or a modern module bundler, and would rather prefer a single-file UMDbuild that makes ReactRedux available as a global object, you can grab a pre-built version from cdnjs. We don’t recommend this approach for any serious application, as most of the libraries complementary to Redux are only available on npm.

React Native
As of React Native 0.18, React Redux 5.x should work with React Native. If you have any issues with React Redux 5.x on React Native, run npm ls react and make sure you don’t have a duplicate React installation in your node_modules. We recommend that you use npm@3.xwhich is better at avoiding these kinds of issues.
If you are on an older version of React Native, you’ll need to keep using React Redux 3.x branch and documentation because of this problem.
